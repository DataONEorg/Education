Understanding the types, processes, and frameworks of workflows and analyses is helpful for researchers seeking to understand more about research, how it was created, and what it may be used for. This lesson uses a subset of data analysis types to introduce reproducibility, iterative analysis, documentation, provenance and different types of processes. Described in more detail are the benefits of documenting and establishing informal (conceptual) and formal (executable) workflows.
