There are several important elements to digital preservation, including data protection, backup and archiving. In this lesson, these concepts are introduced and best practices are highlighted with case study examples of how things can go wrong. Exploring the logistical, technical and policy implications of data preservation, participants will be able to identify their preservation needs and be ready to implement good data preservation practices by the end of the module.
