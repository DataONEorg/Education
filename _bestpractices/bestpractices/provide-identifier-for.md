## Best practice

In order to ensure replicable data access:

- Choose a broadly utilized Data Identification Standard based on specific user community practices or preferences
  - DOI
  - OIDs
  - ARKs
  - LSIDs
  - XRIs
  - URNs/URIs/URLs
  - UUIDs

- Consistently apply the standard

- Maintain the linkage

- Participate in implementing infrastructure for consistent access to the resources referenced by the Identifier

## Description Rationale

Digital objects should utilize a standard, stable identifier to access a specific data product to ensure data consistency among analyses that use the “same” data product.

## Related best practices

- Consider the compatibility of the data you are integrating
- Provide a citation and document provenance for your dataset
- Identify and use relevant metadata standards
