# What are you submitting?   
---     
At DataONE, educational materials fall into three categories:    
<ul>
  <ol>
    <B><li>best practice</li>     
    <li>lesson</li>      
    <li>video</li></B>
    </ol>     
 </ul>
 Each of these three types has a unique submission process, so you must determine which category your submission classifies as.<br><br>   

# Best Practice

<ul>
  <li>A <B>best practice</B> is a method or approach that is recognized by a community as the best or most appropriate way of acquiring, managing, analyzing, and sharing data.</li>
  <li>A best practice communicates a <B><i>single idea</i></B> and can be likened to a single bulletin point on a topic, whereas a lesson will contain multiple points and ideas on a topic.</li>
  <li>Consequently, a best practice is a <B>shorter, less involved</B> submission type.</li>
  <li>A best practice is a single-document submission written in Markdown <i><B>(example given on the right)</B></i>.</li>
  <li>Overall, a best practice should include four short sections covering the following:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>the <B>best practice</B> itself</li>
      <li>a <B>description rationale</B> behind the best practice</li>
      <li><B>additional information</B>, usually a citation of an article or website where you can learn more about the best practice</li>
      <li><B>examples</B></li>
    </ol>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> A <B>lesson</B> is most commonly a slideshow on a subject. It is an <B>in-depth guide</B> for learning a specific topic and is developed with <B>learning objectives</B> in mind.</li>

    <li>a powerpoint</li>
    <li>a handout</li>
    <li>an exercise</li>

</ul>
