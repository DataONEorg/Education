When first sharing research data, researchers often raise questions about the value, benefits, and mechanisms for sharing. Many stakeholders and interested parties, such as funding agencies, communities, other researchers, or members of the public may be interested in research, results and related data. This lesson addresses data sharing in the context of the data life cycle, the value of sharing data, concerns about sharing data, and methods and best practices for sharing data.
