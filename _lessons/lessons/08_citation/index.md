Data citation is a key practice that supports the recognition of data creation as a primary research output rather than as a mere byproduct of research. Providing reliable access to research data should be a routine practice, similar to the practice of linking researchers to bibliographic references. After completing this lesson, participants should be able to define data citation and describe its benefits; to identify the roles of various actors in supporting data citation; to recognize common metadata elements and persistent data locators and describe the process for obtaining one, and to summarize best practices for supporting data citation.
