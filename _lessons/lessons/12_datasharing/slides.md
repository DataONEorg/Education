# The Data Lifecycle

Several stages require critical attention to ensure effective data sharing

| Step         | Action                                                        |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Describe** | document the data content, character and process              |
| **Deposit**  | store the data in a location from which it can be accessed    |
| **Preserve** | select storage formats and media with long term use in mind   |
| **Discover** | publish information about the data so that others can find it |

???

Effective data sharing requires careful thought during each stage of the data development process including:

* description and documentation of the data process, content, and character;
* deposition and storage of the data in a location from which it can be accessed or shared;
* preservation of the data using a format and media that enable long term reuse; and
* making the data discoverable by publishing information about the data in research publications, data clearinghouses and data distribution portals.


---

# Why share data

Data sharing requires effort, resources, and faith in others. Why do it?

.one-half[For the benefit of:
* the public
* the research sponsor
* the research community
* the researcher
]

.one-half[

]


???

Why expend the extra effort to share data? Because it benefits the public, the research sponsor, the research community and, perhaps most importantly, the researcher.

---

# Value of Data Sharing: To the Public

A better informed public yields better decision making with regard to:

.two-third[* Environmental and economic **planning**
* Federal, state, and local **policies**
* **social choices** such as use of tax dollars and education options
* personal **lifestyle and health** such as nutrition and recreation
]

.one-third[![CC image by falonyates on Flickr](images/image7.jpeg)
*CC image by falonyates on Flickr*
]

???

How does the public benefit from shared research?
The more informed the public the better they are able to understand and contribute toward effective public and personal decisions:

* environmental and economic planning
* federal, state and local policies
* social choices such as voting, use of tax dollars and education options
* personal lifestyles and health choices such as exercise, smoking, and nutrition

# Value of Data Sharing: To Research Sponsor

* Organizations that sponsor research must maximize the value of research dollars
* Data sharing enhances the value of research investments by enabling:
  * verification of performance **metrics and outcomes**
  * new research and increased **return on investment**
  * advancement of the **science**
  * **reduced** data duplication **expenditures**
  * enhancing and **extending the record** of science

???

Why do research sponsors encourage data sharing? Because sponsors have an obligation to maximize the investment of research dollars.

Data sharing enhances the value of the research investment by enabling external reviewers to verify the project performance metrics and outcomes. This not only increases the credibility of the data but also spurs new research that can build upon the initial investment and advance the science rather than duplicate expenditures.

# Value of Data Sharing: To Scientific Community

Access to related research enables community members to:
.one-half[* build upon the work of others and further, rather than repeat, the science
* perform meta analyses that cannot be performed with individual datasets or laboratories
* share resources and perspectives so that comprehension is expanded and enhanced
]

.one-half[

]


???

The scientific community as a whole also benefits from sharing among researchers. Data sharing allows researchers to build upon one another's work and to further, rather than duplicate, the science by exploring new findings or combining findings into meta analyses that cannot be performed with individual data. In sharing data, the scientific community expands both individual perspectives and the collective comprehension.

# Value of Data Sharing: To Scientific Community

Access to related research enables community members to (cont’d):

* increase transparency, reproducibility and comparability of results
* expand methodology assessment, recommendations and improvement
* educate new researchers as to the most current and significant findings

![Image of beakers](images/beakers.jpg)

???

Access to related research enables members of the scientific community to better reproduce, compare and assess methods and results. Scientists are able to learn from one another and educate new researchers as to the most current and significant findings.

---

# Value of Data Sharing: To the Scientist
.two-third[
Scientists that share data gain the benefit of:

* research sponsor recognition as an authoritative source and wise investment
* improved data quality due to expanded use, field checks, and feedback
* greater opportunity for data exchange
* improved connections to scientific network, peers, and potential collaborators
]

.one-third[

]

???

And finally, how does the independent researcher benefit from data sharing? When scientists share their data, they gain recognition as an authoritative source and respect as a wise investment for research dollars. When data are exposed, feedback from the broader community can be used to improve the quality and presentation of the data. Shared data also allows for greater opportunity for data exchange and networking opportunities with peers and potential collaborators.

# Concerns About Data Sharing

Researchers may worry that the data will be taken out of context, misinterpreted or used inappropriately.

| Problem                                                                     | Solution |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------:|
| inappropriate use due to misunderstanding of research purpose or parameters | **?**    |
| security and confidentiality of sensitive data                              | **?**    |
| lack of acknowledgement / credit                                            | **?**    |
| loss of advantage when competing for research dollars                       | **?**    |


???

Researchers may worry that the data will be taken out of context, misinterpreted or used inappropriately. They may also be concerned about maintaining the confidentiality and security of sensitive data. Business concerns may arise as well. Will data users give proper credit and acknowledgement to the scientist? Will the scientist lose a competitive advantage by sharing this valuable resource?

# Concerns About Data Sharing

Each of these issues can, in great part, be addressed by providing rich data documentation known as ‘metadata’.

| Problem                                                                     | Solution     |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------:|
| inappropriate use due to misunderstanding of research purpose or parameters | **metadata** |
| security and confidentiality of sensitive data                              | **metadata** |
| lack of acknowledgement / credit                                            | **metadata** |
| loss of advantage when competing for research dollars                       | **metadata** |

# Concerns About Data Sharing

The metadata does NOT contain the data.

| Problem | Solution     |
|:---------------|:----------------------|
| inappropriate use due to misunderstanding of research purpose or parameters | provide rich Abstract, Purpose, Use Constraints and Supplemental Information where needed |
| security and confidentiality of sensitive data | Use Constraints specify who may access the data and how |                  

---

# Concerns About Data Sharing Cont'd

Consider audiences, usability, versions.

| Problem | Solution     |
|:---------------|:----------------------|
| lack of acknowledgement / credit | specify a required data citation within the Use Constraints |
| loss of advantage when competing for research dollars | create second, public version with generalized Data Processing Description |

# Best Practices for Sharing Data (1)

Shared data should align with the FAIR principles:

| FAIR | Principle | How to check |
|:----:|:----------|:----------|
| **F** | Findable | Do the data have a unique ID? Are they discoverable via web search? |
| **A** | Accessible | Can the data be accessed without logging in or paywalls? |
| **I** | Interoperable | Can the data be used by humans and computers without special software? |
| **R** | Re-usable | Do the data have sufficient metadata and clear reuse policies?|

# Best Practices for Sharing Data (2)

The primary goal of sharing data is to support reuse, by you and others. In this light, here are *"Nine simple ways to make it easier to (re)use your data"* [1]

- **Share your data (1)**
 - An obvious but critical first step.
- **Provide metadata (2)**
 - "The first key to using data is understanding it."
- **Provide an unprocessed form of the data (3)**
 - The most useful data is often in raw form.
- **Use standard data formats (4)**
 - file formats that are non-proprietary and can be read by most software
 - table formats that follow spreadsheet best practices
 - standard formats within cells

# Best Practices for Sharing Data (3)

The primary goal of sharing data is to support reuse, by you and others. In this light, here are *"Nine simple ways to make it easier to (re)use your data"* [1]

- **Use good null values (5)**
 - Practices vary across discipline and software. Pick one & document the choice in your metadata.
- **Make it easy to combine your data with other datasets (6)**
 - Include important contextual information that's common in your field
- **Perform basic quality control (7)**
- **Use an established repository (8)**
- **Use an established and open license (9)**

# Data in Real Life

In 2003, a group of scientists from the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug  Administration, drug and medical imaging industries, universities, and nonprofit groups joined in a collaborative effort to find the biological markers  that show the progression of Alzheimer’s disease in the human brain.

The goal of this project was to do research on a massive scale that would involve sharing and making accessible all the data uncovered to anyone in the world with a computer.

Dr. John Trojanowski an Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of Pennsylvania stated,  “It’s not science the way most of us have practiced it in our careers. But we all realized that we would never get biomarkers unless all of us parked our egos and intellectual-property noses outside the door and agreed that all of our data would be made public immediately.”
