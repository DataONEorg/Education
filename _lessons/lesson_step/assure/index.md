###What is a Lesson?

Lessons are education materials publically available to support skillbuiliding of best data managemnet practices. Lessons can include pdf and powerpoint slide decks, handoubts, and supporting exercises and data that you can download and incorporate into your teaching materials. Materials are licensed as CC0 and you may enhance and reuse for your own purposes. In many cases slides can be previewed in the embedded slideshare viewer. We also provide one-page synopses (with space for contact information) that can be used to promote Data Management training events at your institution.

Please consider sharing your own data management teaching materials. For more information see our Frequently Asked Questions and Contributor Guidelines.


### What is the "Assure" stage?

Employ quality assurance and quality control procedures that enhance the quality of data (e.g., training participants, routine instrument calibration) and identify potential errors and techniques to address them.
