<B><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1IrXJwH3BoS_Zpb5MZi04YMjqeFHvQBTU" align="center" height="" width="75" > Forking a repository</B><br>
To submit content to the Skillbuilding Hub, you need to first <B>create a fork</B> of DataONEorg's Education repository. This means you will be creating <B><i>your own private copy</i></B> of the Education repository and storing it in your <B><i>GitHub account online</i></B>. Here, <i><B>in your fork</B></i>, you can edit and upload content <B><i>without affecting the original</i></B>.The forking process will take a few minutes at most. Once you've perfected your changes, you will later <B>merge</B> the changes you have made back into the original repository.<br><br>

<B>1. Create an account online at <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ovyl_eW1AhSYCqEsp8jsb0VsPebNT0EG" align="center" height="" width="25" > <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" junk="_">GitHub</a>, if you don't already have one.</B><br><br><br>

<B>2. To start the forking process, go to DataONEorg's <a href="https://github.com/DataONEorg/Education" target="_blank" junk="_">Education repository</a>.</B><br><br><br>

<B>3. In the right hand corner of DataONEorg's Education repository, click the "fork" button.</B>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you are logged into your GitHub account before you press fork.</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1KJ3kvkiB0WbixBEfN54GuGWhgLs-qYC6" align="center" height="" width="800" class="indented"><br><br>

<B>4. The forking process is complete!</B> Check "your repositories" in your account to make sure the Education repository was successfully forked.<br><br>

<B>5. Download a PNG file of your organization's logo onto your computer</B>
<ul>
  <li>If you are associated with a university, company, or other organization you must include their logo along with your submission.</li>
  <li>Once you have downloaded the logo, make sure to name the .PNG after your organization</li>
  <li><B><i>For now the PNG will be saved on your desktop, but later we will upload it to a specific location in DataONE's GitHub repository</i></B></li>
</ul>
</details>

### Step Two: Submittting the Best Practice
---
---
> **Items necessary for this step:**     
> - [x]  a text file (e.g. a Word document, Notepad, Google Docs, any text editor, etc.)
> - [x]  your organization's logo (.PNG only)

<details>
<summary style="color:teal;"><B>Instructions</B></summary>

<B>Creating the "frontmatter" file</B><br>

For every best practice submitted to the Skillbuilding Hub, the document must also have a front section containing metadata information about the best practice. This section of the best practice is also called the <B><i>"frontmatter"</i></B>.<br><br>

<b>The following information is needed when submitting a best practice to the Data Management Skillbuilding Hub:</b><br><br>

<ul>
  <li><B>title:</B>The full title of your best practice</li>
  <li><B>layout:</B> is always <i><B>bestpractice_cover</B></i></li>
  <li><B>tags:</B> a list of (short) keywords describing the content of the best practice text</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Click <a href="#tags">here</a> for a list of currently existing tags</li>
    </ul>  
  <li><B>step:</B> a list of one or more steps of the data lifecycle to which this best practice applies.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/DataONEorg/Education/blob/master/_lessons/lessons/02_datasharing/02_datasharing.pdf" target="_blank junk=_">Here's a slideshow explaining the data lifecycle.</a></li>
    </ul>
  <li><B>related:</B> <i><B>(optional)</B></i> Choose one or a few best practices that are related to yours. List their identifier -- an identifier is the first three words of the title, separated by dashes.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/DataONEorg/Education/tree/master/_bestpractices/bestpractices" target="_blank junk=_">List of existing Best Practices</a></li>
    </ul>
  <li><B>update:</B> the date this best practice was created</li>
  <li><B>author:</B> a list of authors that created the best practice</li>
  <li><B>organization:</B> name of organization that oversaw the creation of the best practice</li>
  <li><B>org_url:</B> website of the organization, organization logo will open this webpage when selected</li>
  <li><B>org_logo:</B> name of the organization’s logo file <i><B>(this must be a .png file).</B></i></li>
  <li><B>categories:</B> this must be listed as <i><B>[“Best Practice”]</B></i></li>
</ul>

<b>1. Copy the following text block and paste it into your empty text file</b>    
<pre>
  <code>

<B>2. Fill out the appropriate information for each of the categories</B>

<ul>
<li>Here is an example that follows the proper formatting. <B><i>Note that spaces, indents, lines, and dashes are actually very important here, so be sure to follow the formatting of the example as closely as possible!</i></B></li>
</ul>

Now your frontmatter information is completed. <B><i>Save your text file</i></B>, and we will copy and paste this text at a later step in the submission process.<br><br>

<B>3. Creating your best practice document </B> In your fork, open up the the appropriate folder and click <B>"Create New File."</B><br>

<ul>
  <li>Go to <i>`(yourGitHubAccount)/Education/_bestpractices/bestpractices`</i> and click <B>Create New File</B>, located in the upper right-hand corner</li>

<B>4. Name your file</B><br>      
Name your file for the first three words of the title, separated by dashes, and followed by the <i>.md</i> extension.<br>

<B>5. Copy the "frontmatter" saved in your text file from Step One and paste it here into the markdown (.md) file</B>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Be sure to include the three dashes at the beginning and end of the section</i></li>
  </ul><br>

<B>6. Add the content of your best practice directly into your markdown file</B>
<ul>
  <li>You will be putting your content immediately after the three dashes "---"</li>
  <li>The format for the content of a best practice should be as follows:</li><br>
    <B><ol>
      <li>A description of the best practice</li>
      <li>Description Rationale</li>
      <li>Additional Information</li>
      <li>Examples</li>
    </ol></B>
  </ul>

<B>7. Commit your Changes</B>
<ul>
  <li>Scroll to the bottom of your markdown document to commit your changes</li>
  <li><B><i>Committing</i></B> will submit the markdown file to <B><i>your</i></B> fork of the Education repository</li>
</ul>

<B>9. <i>[Optional Step]</i> Adding images</B>
<ul>
    <li>If your best practice includes images in it, you must upload them to <B><i>your fork</i></B> of the Education Repository.</li>
    <li>Go to <i>`(yourGitHubAccount)/Education/_bestpractices/bestpractices/images`</i> in your fork</li>
    <li>Upload your image to the <i>"images"</i> folder, and give each image a unique identifier.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><i>An image name should begin with it's best practice identifier, followed by an underscore and a word that describes the image itself</i></li>
        <li><i>Images can be .JPG or .PNG</i></li>
      </ul>

<B><i>Creating a pull request</i></B> means that you are requesting the original repository to <B>"pull"</B> or accept all the changes you just made.

<ul>
  <li><i>Do not complete this step until <B>all</B> of the materials necessary for your submission have already been uploaded to GitHub!</i></li>
</ul>

### How is the Data Management Skillbuilding Hub website created?
---
---
The educational resources that exist in DataONE's GitHub repository are rendered into the Data Management Skillbuilding Hub webpage using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" junk="_">Jekyll</a>. When sharing presentations, slides themselves are rendered using <a href="https://github.com/gnab/remark" target="_blank" junk="_">remarkjs</a>. The rendering is done using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" junk="_">GitHub pages</a>, which builds the site from the master branch. You can build the site locally with jekyll serve -w, and it will be available at http://localhost:4000 for you to review.

The stylesheets are defined in resources/styles, and rendered to resources/dataone.css using lessc (just type make from the root).
