Data management planning is the starting point in the data life cycle. Creating a formal document that outlines what you will do with the data during and after the completion of research helps to ensure that the data is safe for current and future use. This lesson describes the benefits of a data management plan (DMP), outlines the components of a DMP, details tools for creating a DMP, provides NSF DMP information, and demonstrates the use of an example DMP.
