This training was delivered online on October 13-14 by BIOS2 fellows Katherine Hébert and Alex Arkilanian.

This training is split into two sessions. The first covers the general principles of visualization and graphic design with elements of visual perception and human psychology. The second covers techniques for tailored visualization such as considerations for complexity and uncertainty through the use of animations and interactive visualizations.

More specifically, this training:

1. Makes an overview of basic data visualization principles, including shapes, sizes, colours, and fonts
2. Discusses how to choose the right visualization for your data, what you want to communicate, and who you want to communicate to
3. Shows tools and principles to tailor visualizations, particularly in making interpretable, interactive, and honest visualizations
